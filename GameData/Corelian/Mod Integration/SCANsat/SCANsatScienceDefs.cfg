{
	@RESULTS
	{
		Corelian = The altimetry scan shows nothing. What were you expecting?
		Thale = Yep, it's definitely very lumpy.
		Pras = The terrain is largely uninteresting, though there are large plateaus that will interest our people back at KSC.
		Atraxi = The scan shows that Atraxi has large box canyons, though you could easily see this by looking at it.

{
	@RESULTS
	{
		Corelian = It turns out, the sensor picks up the rings. Whle there may not be a surface, this will still be useful data for R&D.
		Thale = Not only is Thale lumpy, the surface is still very rough at small scales.
		Pras = The high resolution scanner shows a really boring surface; not much better than the low resolution one.
		Atraxi = Atraxi's canyons seem to have a very flat floor. Landing there should be pretty easy.

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION:HAS[#id[SCANsatBiomeAnomaly]]:FOR[Corelian]:NEEDS[SCANsat]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		Corelian = It seems that gas giants don't have biomes.
		Thale = There really isn't much to look at here. Let's just look at those rings instead.
		Pras = Not too many biomes here. Maybe we should land in the lowlands?
		Atraxi = While this map is a little better than the other moons interor to it, it still doesn't show much variety.

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION:HAS[#id[SCANsatResources]]:FOR[Corelian]:NEEDS[SCANsat]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		Corelian = What, did you think you were going to find something here?
		Thale = There are all sorts of useful resources here. It would make a great mining station, if it weren't for everyone saying that Thale is haunted.
		Pras = Seems to be pretty standard fare, as far as resources go. It's a little dry, though.
		Atraxi = The canyons are full of hydrates! Otherwise, pretty normal.
