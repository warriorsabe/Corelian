	{
		CorelianInSpaceHigh = The radiation dynamics here are fascinating! This data will probably keep our scientists busy for decades to come.
		CorelianInSpaceLow = The radiation at this altitude is getting very intense. Hopefully the shielding is sufficient.
		CorelianFlyingHigh = The atmosphere is somewhat effecive at shielding the radiation.
		CorelianFlyingLow = The geiger counter starts to implode. On the upside, there doesn't seem to be so much radiation down here.
		
		ThaleInSpaceHigh = The ionizing radiation seems to be getting stronger here. Perhaps Thale has to do with it?
		ThaleInSpaceLow = Thale definitely seems to amplify the ionizing radiation impinging on it.
		ThaleSrfLanded = The surface seems to have been neutron activated by Thale's frequent passes through Corelian's radiation belts. This will need further study.
		
		PrasInSpaceHigh = Corelian's radiation seems to be much calmer at this distance.
		PrasInSpaceLow = The ionospheric radiation is much stronger than anticipated. The giant's radiation is lower than expected, though, so there is no net effect on our crew.
		PrasFlyingHigh = The atmosphere's interaction with the radiation is quite complicated. This will definitely interest our scientists.
		PrasFlyingLow = Even with the lack of water vapor, the atmosphere seems to block a significant amount of radiation.
		PrasSrfLanded = The radiation levels are pretty nominal here. This bodes well for future colonization.
		
		AtraxiInSpaceHigh = At this altitude, The solar radiation seems to come through fairly effectively.
		AtraxiInSpaceLow = There seems to be the faint remnants of an ionosphere here.
		AtraxiSrfLanded = The radiation seems to be only minimally affected be the thin ionosphere, and the regular passes through the radiation belts will pose a danger to any future colonists.
