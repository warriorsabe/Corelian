{
	@RESULTS
	{
		CorelianInSPaceHigh = The fish appear to be unaware that the section of space they're in is any different from the interplanetary space you were in earlier. Maybe someone should have told them.
		CorelianInSpaceLow = Many of the tropical fish are swimming into the window, apparently thinking that the planet outside is a coral reef. The rest stay away from them.
		
		ThaleInSpaceHigh = The fish appear disoriented. Must be the spinning.
		ThaleInSpaceLow = The fish appear disoriented, particularly the ones near the window. Must be the spinning.
		ThaleSrfLanded = Many of the fish seem unwell, especially after dropping a rock from the surface in. Interestingly, the pump appeared to slow down when the rock was near it.
		
		PrasInSpaceHigh = Looking down at the moon, you get to work figuring out if any part of it pairs well with the fish in the tank.
		PrasInSpaceLow = The blue sky of the world below makes you wonder if there's possibly any water down there to let these fish swim in.
		PrasSrfLanded = Putting a sample of the surface in the tank, it immediately starts to dissolve. The fish seem annoyed at the now murky water
		
		AtraxiInSpaceHigh = Atraxi reminds you of the Mun, and that reminds you of your desire to grill the fish. Perhaps running an engine at low throttle?
		AtraxiInSpaceLow = Something here is agitating the fish, more than being on a spacecraft already is. Closing the shutters doesn't seem to change anything.
		AtraxiSrfLanded = As soon as you touch the surface of the moon, every living thing in the tank enters a frenzy. Several crash into walls or each other - even the clams seem distressed. The squid, however, is only bothered by the fish, and seems to want to go outside.

{
	@RESULTS
	{
		CorelianInSPaceHigh = The plants seem to think this is Eve all over again.
		CorelianInSpaceLow = As you approach the giant, you notice that the plants seem to be able to grow off of the reflected sunlight alone.
		
		ThaleInSpaceHigh = The plants are growing in helical patterns, perhaps as a result of constantly trying to adjust to the spinning world.
		ThaleInSpaceLow = Early signs of decay are starting to show themselves as you approach. Something about this moon does not go over well with the plants, and you can't say you blame them yourself.
		ThaleSrfLanded = Planting one of your seeds in some Thale regolith, you discover that it doesn't even germinate in this stuff. The fully grown plants die pretty quickly, seemingly starting with the roots.
		ThaleSrfLanded = Most of the seeds you planted in Thale's regolith didn't take root, but one of them grew into a hideously mutated monstrosity.
		
		PrasInSpaceHigh = The plants yearn to be on the surface, seemingly convinced they're looking at Kerbin. Apparently all they notice is the atmosphere.
		PrasInSpaceLow = As you get closer to the world, the plants realize it's the Mun all over again and reject the window.
		PrasSrfLanded = Pras's gravelly surface provides little for the plants, and they resent you for planting them in what amounts to a pile of rocks.
		PrasSrfLanded = While the surface of the moon is woefully inadequate for the plants to grow in, the atmosphere seems to sustain them well. At least, the cold-tolerant ones.
		
		AtraxiInSpaceHigh = Despite the barren, rocky surface, the plants unanimously agree that they like the world below.
		AtraxiInSpaceLow = You can barely see out the greenhouse window anymore - the plants have completely covered it, seemingly trying their hardest to leave.
		AtraxiSrfLanded = Planting them in a sample of Atraxi's regolith, the plants seem to be sustained just like on Kerbin, despite the lack of water. What's more, a seed you dropped outside even seems to be taking root - in hard vacuum.

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION:HAS[#id[sspxVisualObservation]]:FOR[Corelian]:NEEDS[StationPartsExpansionRedux]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		CorelianInSPaceHigh = Corelian's shape coming into view, it becomes clear that this is a planet unlike any you've visited before.
		CorelianInSpaceLow = The massive rings clearly visible out the window, you feel compelled to EVA and fly through them.
		
		ThaleInSpaceHigh = Watching the moon spin below is hypnotic, and you lose track of time. Finally pulling away leaves you dizzy.
		ThaleInSpaceLow = As you transitioned below synchronous orbit, the apparent reversal of motion caused your head to spin. Strangely, it doesn't seem to be getting much better.
		ThaleSrfLanded = You thought solid ground would make your head feel better, but this ground does not feel solid at all. On the plus side, you have an amazing view of the planet and its rings, albeit one that's moving uncomfortably fast.
		ThaleSrfLandedHighlands = The spinning has left you too disoriented to make any detailed observations, but it's certainly a breathtaking view.
		
		PrasInSpaceHigh = Looking at the world far below you, the juxtaposition of blue sky and gray, cratered surface strikes you first. As you make more detailed observations, you see it has high, sharp plateaus that differentiate it from the Mun a bit. This revelation will cause quite the stir back home.
		PrasInSpaceLow = You wonder what the moon would look like with Kerbin-like clouds. The sky may be just a bit too much like Kerbin then though.
		PrasSrfLanded = The barren, gray landscape stretches as far as the eye can see, in stark contrast to the blue sky and pink planet above.
		PrasSrfLandedPlateaus = The barren, gray landscape stretches as far as the eye can see, punctuated by the occasional crater. It stands in stark contrast to the blue sky and pink planet above.
		
		AtraxiInSpaceHigh = Atraxi's surface is defined by massive, snaking canyons and marked with numerous craters. It appears that some massive calamity struck this moon once.
		AtraxiInSpaceLow = From low orbit, one could easily mistake Atraxi for the Mun, at least until one of its canyons comes into view. It's certainly a sight to behold.
		AtraxiSrfLanded = The terrain out the window is remarkably like the Mun. Perhaps we can fake a Mun landing here.
		AtraxiSrfLandedCanyons = This canyon basin is something else indeed. The floor is covered in smooth, watercarved rocks, while the massive, sheer cliff faces stand imposingly in the distance.
