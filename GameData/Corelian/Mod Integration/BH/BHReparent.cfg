			@description = Drohze lived its life floating nearly alone in the black, with only a few, lifeless fellow moons. It was generally forgotten by all of civilisation, yet still resided far enough outside of Kerbol's blast zone to survive. Some time during the escape of this system, a large asteroid impacted the surface of this dwarf planet, appearing to have merged with it but still leaving a huge crater behind. <color=#32B0FF>Science bonuses will be awarded for gathering science from the gorges.</color>

		@#LOC_CR_Planets_Corelian_description = With its rings, pink coloration, and overall brightness from our former homes, Corelian used to be the most recognizable planet in the night sky. Due to this, it was often featured in popular media, though often incorrectly. Astronomers are divided as to whether the rings can cut things in two like a buzzsaw.
