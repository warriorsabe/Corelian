		#LOC_CR_Planets_Atraxi_displayName = Atraxi^N
		#LOC_CR_Planets_Atraxi_description = About the size and color of the Mun, not much attention was paid to Atraxi when it was first found. The recent discovery of Atraxi's canyons and unusually high mass has made it a much more scientifically interessting destination. 
		#LOC_CR_Planets_Atraxi_BiomeName1 = Canyons
		#LOC_CR_Planets_Atraxi_BiomeName2 = Lowlands
		#LOC_CR_Planets_Atraxi_BiomeName3 = Midlands

		#LOC_CR_Planets_Corelian_displayName = Corelian^N
		#LOC_CR_Planets_Corelian_description = With its rings and pink coloration, Corelian is the most recognizable planet in the night sky. It is often featured in popular media because of this. Astronomers are divided as to whether the rings can cut things in two like a buzzsaw.

		#LOC_CR_Planets_Pras_displayName = Pras^N
		#LOC_CR_Planets_Pras_description = When it was discovered, Pras was considered one of the most boring worlds in the solar system. Recently, astronomers have discovered the presence of an oxygenated atmosphere, bumping it back a couple spaces on the "most boring worlds" list.
		#LOC_CR_Planets_Pras_BiomeName1 = Poles

		#LOC_CR_Planets_Pras_BiomeName5 = Plateaus

		
		#LOC_CR_Planets_Thale_displayName = Thale^N
		#LOC_CR_Planets_Thale_description = Corelian's smallest moon, Astronomers thought that Thale pulsated by some unknown mechanism. When they got enough money to buy a bigger telescope, however, they discovered that it merely rotated quickly.
		#LOC_CR_Planets_Thale_BiomeName1 = Basins
