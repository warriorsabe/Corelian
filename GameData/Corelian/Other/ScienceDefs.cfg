		PrasSrfLanded = You wonder what it would be like to live here.
		PrasSrfLandedLowlands = The air is thin here, like on a high mountain. You try taking your helmet off and find breathing to be difficult, but possible.

		PrasSrfLanded = Yep, it's gravel. Space gravel!
		PrasSrfLanded = The gravel seems to be lacking any sort of fine dust, suggesting that the gravel layer continues quite some distance down. It also suggests that cleaning the suits after this should be easy.
		
		AtraxiSrfLanded = The dust-covered rocks seem to be sedimentary in nature. They also seem to be profoundly boring.

		ThaleSrfLanded = Some of the samples explode when placed on the surface. How many more do we have?
		ThaleSrfLandedHighlands = Many of the samples spill on the floor. Those that don't boil do when they touch Thale's surface.

		PrasInSpace = This is definitely the most massive of Corelian's moons. Its surface layers are less dense than they should be for a rocky body.
		PrasInSpaceLowPlateaus = There seems to be significant mass concentrations below the plateaus.
		PrasSrfLanded = The tides seem to affect the moon in complicated ways.

		AtraxiSrfLanded = Atraxi is fully differentiated, with an unusually large and sulfur-poor core for a world its size. While it has almost no molten outer core, it does have a separate upper and lower mantle like Kerbin.

		PrasSrfLanded = The ionosphere appears to extend to the surface, even at night. This is quite unusual, and most likely due to the proximity to Corelian's radiation belts.
		
		AtraxiSrfLanded = Atraxi has a very low level ambient static electric field that the instrument seems to pick up. It also picks up Corelian's outer radiation belt whenever Atraxi passes through it, revealing much about Corelian's radiation environment.
