			description = With its rings, pink coloration, and overall brightness from Kerbin, Corelian is the most recognizable planet in the night sky. Due to this, it is often featured in popular media, though often incorrectly. Astronomers are divided as to whether the rings can cut things in two like a buzzsaw.
